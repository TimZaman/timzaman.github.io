# 2D Rapid Scanning

I've created some custom hardware, and written a ton of software for digital image processing.
Notable clients included a few Smithsonian Museums in the USA, and the MoMA in NYC. Most projects
involved digitization of full or partial collections, with millions of samples needing digitization.

## Online Image Quality Software - delt.ae

In 2011, we made a website [link](https://deltae.picturae.com/) where you can upload an image with
'quality calibration targets'. These will then be automatically identified, analyzed, and
benchmarked against existing image quality standards. This system is used by fortune 500 companies,
and practically all the digital imaging labs of big archives and museums across the world.
