-----

This mission was special as it had a live camera broadcast from the payload. It used a 5mW
transmitter on 433 MHz to send JPEGs with [forward error correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_error_correction)
down at [baud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baud) (bits per second) levels up to 1200.
