# Space Camera 1

*1 Aug 2010*<br />

![Image](docs/space-cameras/1/space-camera-1-header.jpg)

-----

Project Hollands Hoogte: Scientific / Educational High Altitude near-space balloon project from
The Netherlands.
_aka "Project HoHoHo I"_

Buy a balloon, put helium in. Attach a camera, and let it go, then pick it up when it lands! Sounds easy? It is! We put a GPS device in the balloon, that broadcasted its location through radiosignals so we knew where it was during flight. So we picked it up from the ijsselmeer, where it landed. It taped video and took many pictures on its journey through 32km of atmosphere. It's result is displayed below.

### First a picture!

_Oh hi: it's the provice of Friesland from 31km altitude!_

Tracked it with GPS, that we picked up in the car with a radio, and got an sms from the payload when it splashed down in the middle of the ijsselmeer. Asked someone for a boat, and chased the payload, and found it, still making pictures! Hence the pictures here..
If you have Google Earth you can download this file TODO(tzaman): add KML that includes the trajectory on the earth, including thumbnails of ALL the pictures taken over north holland! It's only 3Mb big.

_It splashed down in the Ijsselmeer. We just asked someone's boat and picked it up! (see the end of the video)_

_These were all the GPS positions that we received from launch to splashdown (you can download this data if you scroll down)_

_Sensor graphs_

The formula for the Light Value in the bottom graph is from the camera. (It's like EV but it takes ISO in account). I had absolutely no idea what exposure you need in "space", so i set it to automatic. It turns out an EV of around 14 would be best (for instance 1/500 f5.6 ISO100).

```
LV=log2(Fnumber^{2}/Shutterspeed/ (ISO/100))
```

_Some people helped tracking the balloon live with their radio's. One of them from Schotland, 460km away picked up our GPS signals from the balloon!_
