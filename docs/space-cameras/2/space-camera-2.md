# Space Camera 2

*19 Dec 2010*<br />

-----

Aka _"Project HoHoHo III"_ This is the second meteorological balloon I have launched. It included some sensors, two flightcomputers and four (!) camera’s. The project failed due to the radio breaking during launch, so i lost all contact, and the payload was recovered 2 months later by a German lady. Also, only one camera worked, and that actualy videotaped for 3.5 hours on just 2 AA batteries. So all is left is the video, which turned out great.

Where did it go wrong?

I turned the payload on, everything worked. Then i turned the radio off, and let the payload go. Then i turned the radio back on, and everything was distorted. At least the flightcomputer worked 3 minutes, since it made the EOS350D take a few pictures, and it sent me a textmessage that it worked (via the T68i). Then, something went wrong with the powersupply, making the entire flightcomputer and the EOS350D it controlled fail. The cellphone worked too, because it had received a _"Welcome to Germany!"_ textmessage when it landed there. But, the flightcomputer was broken, so it did not parse through a textmessage with GPS info to the phone.

## Recovery
Eventually the payload landed after a long time in the air in an orchard in Osterholz-Schambeck, above Bremen, at the hight of Denmark. After two months i got a phonecall from a very nice lady named Claudia (danke!), and after paying the findersfee and the postage, it took two days after receiving the box. Besides the experience, i now have all the equipment back here, for possibly a new project.
