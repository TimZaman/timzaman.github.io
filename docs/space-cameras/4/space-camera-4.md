*7 Nov 2011*<br />

-----

For TEDx 2011, I was asked to do a talk about the 'space camera' projects. I decided I'd do a 
live launch during the talk, and show the images live.

## Retrieval

We had lost connection to the payload, but someone in Rotterdam found it on the street, and
called us up for the $100 bounty. Immediatelly when it landed, a woman got it. It landed 20 meters
from the river Maas in Rotterdam. She tried to call us (i didnt pick up, I was attending a
TEDx Delft talk, she thought it was a bomb, so “She opened it ” (=ripped the whole front off).
Then she called the police, which said "Oh yeah we know about that, it’s not a bomb", then I 
called her, picked it up after a 15 minute drive!
