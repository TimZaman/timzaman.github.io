This launch was done for a Dutch national tv programme called 'Proefkonijnen' (BNN broadcasting).

This was a dual payload launch. The first payload contained most importantly a Instant-Film
'Polaroid' (Fujifilm) camera (not a *real* Polaroid). And some simple electronics with a GPS/radio
system as a backup for the first payload. That first payload contained the Live image stream
payload for live image transmission together with a GPS. It also included various other sensors, and, two GoPro Hero camera's for "BNN" which is a dutch broadcasting agency. They have a pseudo-science show in which they try to ask scientific questions like "Can one take a photograph from space". Well, obviously, yes that can be done.
The other question was more fun though, "Do polaroids develop in space?". Well, the answer is kinda. This was our very first test, with the very first instantfilms or 'polaroids' ever taken and developed in space. 

Broadcast was on Dutch national television, NED3, at 21:40 on Wednesday 1 Feb.

We tracked the balloon during flight by two "chase" cars. This is what we say during the flights. We got its GPS position by the small radiotransmitter that we received in our car-radio's.
