# Space Cameras

*2010-2013*<br />

-----

During 2010~2013, I launched a series of payloads connected to high altitude ballons. All
of these were connected through a home brew radio transmission and GPS so I could chase them
in a car ([and once, a speed-boat!](https://timzaman.github.io/space-camera-1)). All missions ended
in succesful recovery. One was for a [TEDx talk](https://timzaman.github.io/space-camera-4),
one was for [dutch national television](https://timzaman.github.io/space-camera-5).

All of these had (video) cameras
([and once, a Polaroid camera](https://timzaman.github.io/polaroids-from-space)) attached to 
snap pictures from this high altitude.
