_Distributed clogging at scale. If you were wondering; then yes, I am from Holland - though based in ~~SF~~ Bay Area._

I am a mechanical engineer at heart (MSc biorobotics), but I am a lazy human so I just sit down on my chair and do software.

I ran my own company until 2016, working with software and hardware for cameras systems serving many international customers like the Smithsonian Museum, MoMa and many others. During this, I also pursued a part-time PhD on imaging devices for cultural heritage. But I got into AI and persued that at NVIDIA and at Tesla and also at X (Twitter) but now they call it AGI at Google Deepmind.

Radio operator callsign: **PD4TA**.
