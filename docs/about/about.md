# About/Contact

Hello. I'm Tim Zaman, ~~22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29~~ 30 y.o. and I'm currently a software engineer for NVIDIA's deep learning ("artificial intelligence") AI-Infrastructure. From 2013-2016 i was doing a part-time PhD in the development of imaging devices for cultural heritage applicationsÂ at the Delft University of Technology (NL). The other part of the time I've had my own company, working with software and hardware for cameras. Notably working on digitisation software I created for the Smithsonian Museum, MoMa and many others. I like cameras, software, hardware, electronics, programming, electronics, education, finance. I have a MSc in biorobotics (mechanical engineering). Tried a (part-time) PhD for a few years. Radio operator callsign: **PD4TA**.
