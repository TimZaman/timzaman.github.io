# About/Contact

Hello. I'm Tim Zaman, ~~22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30~~ 31 y.o. and I'm currently a software engineer for ~~NVIDIA's~~ Tesla's machine learning (AI) infrastructure.

_Distributed clogging at scale. If you were wondering; then yes, I am from Holland._

I am a mechanical engineer by heart (MSc biorobotics), but I am a lazy human so I just sit down on my chair and do software.

I ran my own company until 2016, working with software and hardware for cameras systems serving many international customers like the Smithsonian Museum, MoMa and many others. During this, I also pursued a part-time PhD on imaging devices for cultural heritage.

Radio operator callsign: **PD4TA**.
